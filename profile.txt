Description: Developed a Proof of Concept (POC) for a Python-based framework to validate the integrity
and completeness of data during migration processes. The framework was designed to automate the
comparison of source and target data within a local database environment, ensuring that all data was
transferred accurately.
Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
Designed and implemented a Python POC framework to automate data migration testing, ensuring
data integrity within a controlled local database environment.
Utilized Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries, such as pandas for data manipulation and openpyxl for Excel file
handling, to facilitate data extraction and comparison.
Developed a system to input database credentials via an Excel sheet, enabling the framework to
dynamically connect to local databases, execute SQL queries, and retrieve relevant data.
Automated the identification and reporting of lost or mismatched data by exporting discrepancies to a
separate Excel file, streamlining the testing process.
Addressed the challenge of identifying Primary Composite Keys, crucial for accurate data comparison
across complex tables, by implementing advanced query logic.
Project Name: HRMS Automation
Description: As a core member of the team, contributed to the development of a robust automation
framework for an HR Management System (HRMS) to enhance the efficiency of testing processes. This
project involved writing manual test cases, identifying critical bugs, and creating a comprehensive
automation solution from scratch using C# and SpecFlow. The framework was integrated with NUnit and
Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD), and included advanced reporting capabilities with
Extent Reports.
Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
Manual Testing: Authored detailed manual test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage of HRMS
functionalities, leading to the discovery of major bugs, including a critical issue where Leave
Encashment was not updating when leaves were canceled.
Framework Design: Designed and developed a custom automation framework from scratch using C#
and SpecFlow, facilitating efficient and scalable test automation.
Integration with NUnit and Cucumber: Successfully integrated the framework with NUnit for unit
testing and Cucumber for BDD, enabling more readable and maintainable test cases.
Automation of Test Cases: Automated the manual test cases, significantly reducing the time required
for regression testing and improving overall test accuracy.
Version Control: Utilized Git for version control, ensuring efficient collaboration and version
management across the team.
Enhanced Reporting: Integrated Extent Reports into the framework, with features to automatically
capture and include screenshots in the report whenever an error occurred, providing detailed and
actionable insights for faster issue resolution.

Project Name: Doctor Care Anywhere (DCA)
Description: Worked on automating existing test scripts for a healthcare company project, enhancing test
efficiency and framework usability. The project utilized Serenity with Java for test automation, Azure for
pipeline execution (though not directly involved in deployment), Testrail for test case management, and
Confluence for documentation. Executed pipelines to ensure smooth test operations and reporting.
Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
Suggested Framework Updates: Proposed updates to the automation framework to improve
reusability and maintainability, ensuring that the framework could be easily reviewed and archived for
the client.
Automated Repetitive Tasks: Streamlined manual processes by automating repetitive tasks, improving
efficiency and reducing manual effort for the team.
Optimized Pipeline Execution: Reduced pipeline execution time not only through parallel runs but by
creating independent users to avoid dependencies and enhance execution speed.
Enhanced Framework Robustness: Collaborated with developers to refine the API interactions, making
the framework more robust and reliable.
Created JAR Files: Developed and provided JAR files containing reusable methods, facilitating faster
development and integration for the team.
Owned Web Framework: Took full ownership of the Web Framework, including maintenance and
enhancement.
Client and Team Training: Conducted training sessions for both the client and internal team on
framework usage and how to trigger pipelines effectively.
Met Deadlines and Added Value: Consistently met project deadlines while contributing additional
enhancements and improvements to the framework and processes
